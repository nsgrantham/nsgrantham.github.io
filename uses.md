I use a number of programs in my data science workflow.

## Programming languages

When I'm exploring a new dataset for the first time, I reach for [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I have used R regularly since 2009 when I was introduced to it in my statistics classes at Cal Poly. At the time R was not widely used outside of academic statistics departments, but the rise of data science as a new discipline has made R accessible to a much larger audence. Today it is especially welcoming to newcomers to data science, thanks to the contributions of RStudio, tidyverse, and the global community of R developers. I find R most effective for exploratory data analysis and data visualizations with ggplot2.

For data science in production, I depend on [Python](https://www.python.org/). I began using Python in 2015 for an internship with the Crew State Monitoring group at NASA Langley Research Center. Unlike R which specializes in statistics, Python is a general purpose language that I find useful for scraping data from websites, developing end-to-end data analysis pipelines, and training machine learning models.

I used [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for several years in graduate school after I could no longer stomach the sluggish convergence of my Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in R. MCMC for Bayesian analysis is a breeze with Mamba.jl. I do not use Julia frequently these days, but I'm eager to reintroduce it into my workflow afters its recent v1.0 release.

Finally, bash scripts are the glue that holds everything together.

## Code editors

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) almost every day, a fact which may surprise those who know my general distaste for Microsoft products. But it's simple, VS Code is excellent open-source software. I also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) for exploratory data analysis, and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [Tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) for tasks that require heavy use of the terminal.

## Getting things done

I have a personal subscription to GSuite which I use for GMail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Sheets.

In recent months, I have migrated my note keeping and schedule planning to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and I couldn't be happier with it. Notion is difficult to describe, but I view it as a productivity platform for my life. I highly recommend trying it out.

## This website

nsgrantham.com is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted freely with GitHub Pages. Its structure and style is courtesy of Hydeout, a Jekyll 3.x refresh of Hyde, which I have [forked and modified slightly](http://github.com/nsgrantham/hydeout).

## Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that live in a user's home directory. By keeping [my dotfiles on GitHub](http://github.com/nsgrantham/dotfiles), I can get a new system up-and-running in no time at all, backup changes, and share my settings with others. In particular, I maintain my global Git configuration, Zsh aliases, custom Oh-My-Zsh theme, Neovim and Tmux settings, R profile, and Brewfile for macOS.
