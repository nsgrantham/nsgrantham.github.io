## Website Source Code

My website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby, and is hosted freely with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). Its structure and style is courtesy of [Hydeout](http://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout), a Jekyll 3.x refresh of [Hyde](http://github.com/mdo/hyde), which I have [forked and modified slightly](http://github.com/nsgrantham/hydeout).

## Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that live in a user's home directory. By keeping [my dotfiles on GitHub](http://github.com/nsgrantham/dotfiles), I can get a new system up-and-running in no time at all, backup changes, and share my settings with the community. In particular, I maintain my global Git configuration, Zsh aliases, custom Oh-My-Zsh theme, Neovim and Tmux settings, R profile, and Brewfile for macOS.
