I'm a statistician, which means I use statistical models to make data-informed decisions.

In my role as a data scientist at Phylagen in San Francisco, I use machine learning models trained on DNA sequence data from the environmental microbiome to predict where things come from. Before joining Phylagen, I earned my doctorate in statistics in 2017 from North Carolina State University where I worked with Brian Reich to develop Bayesian hierarchical models for high-dimensional spatial data.

When I'm not programming, I like to run, hike, read non-fiction and science fiction, and listen to podcasts on tech, business, history, and politics. I especially enjoy discovering new music and sharing it with others --- for several years I was a weekly radio DJ at WKNC 88.1 FM under the name Voyager 3.
