I'm a statistician, which means I use data to make better decisions.

In my role as a data scientist at Phylagen in San Francisco, I work with large datasets of high-throughput sequencing data on the environmental microbiome. Before joining Phylagen, I earned my doctorate in statistics in 2017 from North Carolina State University where I worked with Brian Reich on Bayesian hierarchical models for spatially-distributed data.

When I'm not programming, I run, hike, read non-fiction and sci-fi books, and listen to podcasts. For several years I was a weekly radio DJ at WKNC 88.1 FM under the name Voyager 3.
