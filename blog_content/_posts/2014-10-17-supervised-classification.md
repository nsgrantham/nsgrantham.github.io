As part of the NCSU Statistical Learning Group (SLG), I gave a 50-minute overview of supervised classification methods in the machine learning literature. My presentation was aimed at an audience of primarily undergraduate and graduate students, not all of whom were statisticians. Please enjoy the videos below and follow along with slides (html) and code (Rmd) in the accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nsgrantham/slg-ncsu-2014-fall/tree/master/04-Grantham). The slides were produced using `RMarkdown v2.0` and `knitr` within `RStudio`.
