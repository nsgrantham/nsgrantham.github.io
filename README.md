# [nsgrantham.github.io](https://nsgrantham.github.io)

My personal website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby, and is hosted freely with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). Its structure and style is courtesy of [Hydeout](http://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout), a Jekyll 3.x refresh of [Hyde](http://github.com/mdo/hyde), which I have [forked and modified slightly](http://github.com/nsgrantham/hydeout).
