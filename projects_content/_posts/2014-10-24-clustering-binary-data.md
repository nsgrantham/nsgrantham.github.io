For my Ph.D. written preliminary exam at NC State, I wrote a literature review on frequentist and Bayesian methods for [clustering binary data with Bernoulli mixture models]({{ site.url }}/documents/clustering-binary-data.pdf). The paper was awarded "Best Written Preliminary Exam" by the Department of Statistics faculty.
