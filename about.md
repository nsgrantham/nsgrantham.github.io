Hello! I am a Data Scientist at [Phylagen](http://www.phylagen.com) in San Francisco where I manage, process, and analyze high-throughput sequencing data on the environmental microbiome. I recently graduated with my doctorate in Statistics from North Carolina State University where I worked with [Brian Reich](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~reich/).
